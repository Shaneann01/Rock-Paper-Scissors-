# Rock-Paper-Scissors-

Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors project!

Within this project, you can vs the computer. 
Depending on both outcomes there is a winner that gets decided. 
I have made it so that the computer picks one of the options at random. 
As well as have included a user input using Scanner. 
Then have used switch and if statements to help determine the winner of the game.
The output shows what you and the computer have selected after the users input. 
Then shows the results on who is the winner or if it was a draw. 

Thank you for playing.
